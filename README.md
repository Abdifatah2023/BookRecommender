## 📚 Book Recommender System

An intelligent **book recommendation system** built with **Python** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.
This project uses **semantic embeddings** to understand book descriptions and recommend similar titles based on meaning, not just keywords.
The interactive **Gradio dashboard** allows users to input a book title or description and instantly receive personalized book recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🧠 **LLM-Powered Understanding:** Generates high-quality semantic embeddings for book descriptions.
* 🔍 **Content-Based Recommendations:** Finds books with similar narratives, genres, and styles.
* 🧩 **Gradio Interface:** Simple, elegant dashboard for interactive exploration.
* 📊 **Scalable and Modular:** Can integrate new datasets or AI models with minimal changes.
* 💡 **Data-Driven Discovery:** Helps readers uncover hidden gems beyond popular titles.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **pandas**, **numpy**, **scikit-learn** – for data processing and similarity computation
* **OpenAI API** or **SentenceTransformers** – for text embeddings
* **Gradio** – to build the user interface
* **Jupyter Notebook** – for model experimentation and analysis

---

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses the **[7k Books with Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)** dataset, which includes:

* Titles
* Authors
* Descriptions
* Genres
* ISBN and publication details

You can replace this dataset with any custom dataset containing similar fields.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Abdifatah2023/BookRecommender.git
cd BookRecommender

# 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4️⃣ Create a .env file for your API key (if using OpenAI)
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# 5️⃣ Run the Gradio app
python app.py
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing** – Cleans and normalizes book descriptions.
2. **Embedding Generation** – Converts text to dense vectors using OpenAI or SentenceTransformers.
3. **Similarity Computation** – Uses cosine similarity to rank the most similar books.
4. **Recommendation Output** – Displays top-N results in the Gradio dashboard.

---

## 🖥️ Gradio Dashboard

Once launched, you’ll see an interface where you can:

* Enter a **book description**
* Choose category as well as an emotional tone

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

Make sure `.env` is **ignored** in your repository:

```gitignore
# .gitignore
.env
```
